# REL-IDverify-API Documentation

## Introduction

REL-IDverify is a feature provided by REL-ID. Using this feature, enterprises can initiate a push notification based approval request to any of their transactional (login / financial transaction or any other approval) operations to the user. REL-ID server ensures to send the notification to user's registered device. Enterprises just need to invoke REST Web service call to REL-ID backend to initiate the notification request, and poll for its status.

REL-IDverify is available for both Android and iOS platforms.

Most importantly, REL-ID uses Google / Apple notification services just as a doorbell (to indicate, there is some notification). This means, the actual transactional information (what resource is accessed, amount for transaction, etc.) is never shared over the public notification services OR with the ISPs. Once the REL-ID app receives a notification, it pulls the actual transactional information though REL-ID's MITM proof secure channel, and shows the prompt to the user to act on the transaction.

The REL-IDverify APIs that enterprise can invoke are authenticated REST web service APIs. REL-ID admin will create a unique "Enterprise ID" along with the authentication credentials and provide these authentication credentials to enterprise developers. Enterprise developers would use these credentials to invoke the REL-IDverify web services. Enterprises can choose to create multiple verify enterprise IDs, so that notifications from different applications / departments etc. can be tracked distinctly.

REL-IDverify exposed these authenticated web service APIs using a web service component, which accepts the http web requests on a configurable port (default 8007). In this document, we have used "REL-ID-VERIFY-SERVER" to indicate host name / IP address of REL-ID server which has the REL-IDverify component, and "VERIFY-PORT" as the port on which REL-IDverify accepts these requests.

## Generate REL-ID Notification Request

Enterprise can use this API to generate the notification (approval) request for their transactional operation. Enterprise must provide unique "message ID" for individual notification request. REL-ID system shall generate a notification, and send it to user's device (apple / android - depending on type of device user has registered with REL-ID).

In case user is not available in REL-ID OR is not in the valid state, this API will return error.

In case of success, it will generate a unique notification-id and will send the notification-id as response. This notification-ID can be used to check status of notification using the next API.

REL-ID provides an option to the enterprise, to define its own messages that needs to be displayed to the user. There are two types of messages. "msg" attribute contains the actual transactional information and "notification_msg" contains the text that flows through public Google / Apple notification servers. We recommend not to send any transactional information using "notification_msg" attribute.

Enterprise can also choose the number of options and text of the actions that needs to be shown to the user. For example, "Approve/Reject" OR "Accept/Decline/Fraud" etc.

Against every action (Accept/Decline), enterprise can also choose the authentication level (none/password/biometric etc) by providing auth_level number. This feature helps to enforce additional authentication on the action.

#### Details of the JSON parameters in Request Body
| Field						| Description 												|
| :----------- 				| :----------------------------------------------------- 	|
| msg_id 					| Unique message id generated by enterprise. <br> Enterprise must provide unique msg_id for every notification. msg_id value can be as simple as the transaction_id generated for the transaction for which enterprise is seeking REL-ID approval. REL-ID system can provide logs OR notification status against the msg_id for forensic purposes or during audits.|
| enterprise_id 			| Enterprise ID provided by REL-ID admin
| user_id 					| user_id of user in REL-ID system|
| msg 						| Actual Transactional Message to be displayed to the user. Contents in the Body will be shown as details to the user. Contents in subject will be shown as subject line for the notification.|
| notification_msg 			| Text that enterprise would like to display in Push notification (For example "you have a login notification"). Do not send transactional information here.
| expiry_time 				| Number of seconds for which REL-ID shall consider lifetime for this notification request. If user does not act on the notification within the given number of seconds, notification will be marked as EXPIRED by REL-ID
| actions 					| Array of JSON objects with label & action text along with authentication level. Each array element is presented as a clickable button. Label value will be used as TEXT to show to the user and Action Text will be send back to enterprise as notification status. On clicking any of the displayed buttons, authlevel option works as follows: <ul><li>if authlevel is 0 - user is not prompted for any additional authentication</li><li>if authlevel is 1 - user is prompted for Password - on successful password authentication notification status is posted to server</li><li>if authlevel is 2 - user is prompted for TouchID/Pattern on iOS/Android - on successful TouchID/Pattern verification notification status is posted to server</li></ul>|

#### Example Notification on App
<div>
	<img  height="auto" width="45%" src="assets/B3.jpg"/><img  height="auto" width="45%" src="assets/B5.jpg"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Check Notification Status

Enterprise will get a unique notifcaiton-uuid upon successful invocation of the first API to generate the notification. Using this notifcaiton-uuid enterprise can keep checking the status of the notification as per desired time intervals.

This request-and-poll architecture ensures that REL-ID servers and enterprise server both does not need to keep the TCP connections open for high number of concurrent notifications.

|Success response <td>
```javascript
{notification_uuid:"<notification_uuid>", response_code:"0", status:<notification_status>, delivery_status:<delivery_status>,a ction_response:"<RESPONSE_TEXT>"}
```
</td>
| status 		 			| <ul><li>**ACTIVE :** Notification is Active (User has not acted on it yet)</li><li>**UPDATED :** User has taken action on the notification on it yet)</li><li>**EXPIRED :** Notification is expired</li></ul>
| delivery_status 			| <ul><li>**NONE :** REL-ID is attempting to deliver notification on Users Device(s)</li><li>**PARTIALLY_NOTIFIED :** User has recived notification on at-least in device (in case he has multiple devices)</li><li>**NOTIFIED :** User has recived notification on ALL the registered devices</li></ul>|
| action_response 			| <ul><li>**NONE :** User has not taken action on notification yet</li><li>**RESPONSE_TEXT :** Please refer the examples below</RESPONSE_TEXT></li>|

#### Action Response Example
For example, if the actions value in the notification request was
```javascript
actions:[{label:"Accept",action:"Accept"}, {label:"Reject",action:"Reject"}]
```

If the User has clicked / tapped on "Accept" label, then RESPONSE_TEXT will be "Accept"

If the User has clicked / tapped on "Reject" label, then RESPONSE_TEXT will be "Reject"

..........

**Another example,** if the actions value in the notification request was **actions:[{label:"Accept",action:"YES"}, {label:"Reject",action:"NO"}]**

If the User has clicked / tapped on "Accept" label, then RESPONSE_TEXT will be "YES"

If the User has clicked / tapped on "Reject" label, then RESPONSE_TEXT will be "NO"

..........
